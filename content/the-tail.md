There is a lot of history behind my tail. It has been to hell and back with me, and can easily be spotted in a crowd. Well, *allegedly.*

I myself do not know why people assert I have a purple and black tail attached to the back of me. It has gotten rather annoying, and really needs to stop. In light of wanting these allegations to stop, about me being something called a “furry” and having grown a tail, I have decided to prove it does not exist once and for all. I shall collect evidence to show the tail does not exist, and continue to post details that people assert are true about this mythical tail.
