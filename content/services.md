## Who We Are

I am Hon1nbo, and I am a Red Team operator with over 15 years of technical experience in the field. I specialise in scenarios where "the gloves are off," and there is a goal to obtain by almost any means available.

#### "We?"

I will often use the Royal "We" for these services, as depending on the nature of the project I have associates that may or may not be onboarded; these are colleauges I have worked with for a number of years. Generally when you hire Hacking & Coffee, you hire Hon1nbo.

## Consulting Services

Our general consulting services contain your usual full-scope, adversarial red team operations. However, we have broad experience in a variety of niche spaces and training:
- Hardware Security Testing for embedded devices an OT
- Tamper Evident detection & forgery testing
- Speaking services at events for educational purposes
- Application Security testing

All of our consulting work can be done from static or dynamic perspectives.
