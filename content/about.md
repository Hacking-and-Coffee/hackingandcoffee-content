***First and foremost,*** the alleged “tail” has its [own section](/the-tail) if you are inquiring about this imaginary purple ball of fluff. Seriously people, grow up. Still here? Ok.

I am Hon1nbo, and I am a Red Team operator; I tend to keep my professional and independent work separate, and this site is devoted to my independent work. Here I post about things I disclose, code I release, and projects I support. In fact, some of them I think I may have invented. Legal abuse techniques are patent pending. What do you mean I can’t patent filing paperwork in the county court system to inject a Cobalt Strike Beacon payload into a target with a cease and desist and unwitting process server? Blah, they’ll approve it.

*Moving On.*

In the meantime while I clean up the dust, and drive the minions to compile the large amount of content in my archives, you can sit there hitting refresh ad-infinitum.
