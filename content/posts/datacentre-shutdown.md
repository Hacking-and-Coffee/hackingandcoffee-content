It was a long time coming, but we finally reached shutdown day for primary services. So naturally, half the links on this site to status monitors, mirrors, and other resources are broken. Some services such as this blog were moved to SaaS for the time being, others completely shutdown.

It’s on my back burner, but this blog will get a revamp. I have a backlog of content to start publishing as well once it gets cleaned up.

To all of our former customers, we thank you for your patronage. To all those who downloaded from our mirrors, we are sorry that you now have to use slower alternatives </snark>

But seriously, it’s been a wild ride. We started hosting around 12 years ago. Thank you all.
