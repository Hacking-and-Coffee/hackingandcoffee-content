The old site was wordpress and is falling apart... or rather, the Wordpress ecosystem is. It's been due for an update for quite some time. I have a backlog of projects and research to do writeups on, so I decided it's time to revamp things. Thanks 0xDezzy for helping in your spare time to work on formatting this with me. I've run a handful of Hugo instances now but I've been swamped with a move to the PNW area, so it's been a huge help.

Once the content is migrated over, and the formatting fixed up a tad, this will migrate to Apex domain and I'll keep the wordpress site on a subdomain for a little while but I expect all updates to happen here.

Cheers,
~H
