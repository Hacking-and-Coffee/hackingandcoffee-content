### The old site
was wordpress and is falling apart... then again, the entire Wordpress ecosystem is failing too so whatever. It's been due for an overhaul for quite some time. I have a backlog of projects and research to do writeups on, so I decided it's time to revamp things. Thanks [0xDezzy](https://github.com/0xDezzy) for helping in your spare time to work on formatting this with me. I've run a handful of Hugo instances now but I've been too swamped working on my long distance move, so it's been a huge help.

### Once the content is migrated over,
and the formatting fixed up a tad, this will migrate to Apex domain and I'll keep the wordpress site on a subdomain for a little while but I expect all updates to happen here.

### Cool Stuff Ahead
Once we settle the formatting, there's bound to be cool stuff updated here as I have quite the backlog. Stay tuned for exciting and dull work such as:
- BGP Shenanigans
- My infamous talk on *Social Engineering & The Human Condition*
- The BSidesDFW badge writeup and lessons learned as a first time conference badge maker
- Outrageous Home lab: 50 Gbps residential service, Zero Trust, and a whole lotta tunneling
- Who knows, maybe even my uncensored contributions to [Rainmaker's](https://infosec.exchange@Andy_Thompson) social engineering talk that was censored by the US Department of Justice because of *Furry* related things.

Cheers,

~H
